You can access the Nuxt context more easily using `useContext`, which will return the Nuxt context.

```ts
import { defineComponent, useContext } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const { store } = useContext()
    store.dispatch('myAction')
  },
})
```

:::alert{type="info"}
Note that `route`, `query`, `from` and `params` are reactive refs (accessed with `.value`), but the rest of the context is not.
:::

:::alert{type="warning"}
To smooth your upgrade to Nuxt 3, it is recommended not to access `route`, `query`, `from` and `params` from `useContext` but rather to use the `useRoute` helper function.
