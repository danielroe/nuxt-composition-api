description: 'You can access the Nuxt fetch() hook within the composition API.'
---

Versions of Nuxt newer than v2.12 support a [custom hook called `fetch`](https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-fetch/) that allows server-side and client-side asynchronous data-fetching.

You can access this with this package as follows:

```ts
import { defineComponent, ref, useFetch } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'
import axios from 'axios'

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const name = ref('')

    const { fetch, fetchState } = useFetch(async () => {
      name.value = await axios.get('https://myapi.com/name')
    })

    // Manually trigger a refetch
    fetch()

    // Access fetch error, pending and timestamp
    fetchState

    return { name }
  },
})
```

:::alert
`useFetch` must be called synchronously within `setup()`. Any changes made to component data - that is, to properties _returned_ from `setup()` - will be sent to the client and directly loaded. Other side-effects of `useFetch` hook will not be persisted.
:::

:::alert{type="warning"}
`useFetch` should be used with `ref`s and not `ssrRef`s because state serialization and hydration is already covered by `useFetch`. Else, the state would be sent from server to client "twice", via the `ssrRef` and via `useFetch`
:::

:::alert{type="info"}
`$fetch` and `$fetchState` will already be defined on the instance - so no need to return `fetch` or `fetchState` from setup.
:::

:::alert{type="info"}
Note that `useFetch` doesn't support use within `onGlobalSetup`.
